**Gradient_LinearModel.py**
* The above algorithm implements gradient descent for linear model(hypothesis space)
* This program takes the input file(comma separated) as input and learns on the same
* As a output you obtain slope and y-intercept for the straight line(m,b) which approximates the data
* The training set is trained for 1000 iterations
